# No-Due-Portal
The project is about online portal for issuing no-due acknowledgement to students on sending their requests to administration.
There are two modules in the project, Student Module to put a request and  Professor Module in which the request moves in hierarchical order.
The Professor Module is categorised into phases highest phase has the HOD
Initially every student is in phase 0,which means his request isn't reviewed by anyone.Then the request is shifted to phase 1,and considering that he has no dues,
the request finally reaches the phase 3 i.e.., the HOD phase and at the end this request is successfully accepted.
