# No-Due-Portal
The project is about online portal for issuing no-due acknowledgement to students on sending their requests to administration.
There are two modules in the project, Student Module to put a request and  Professor Module in which the request moves in hierarchical order.
The Professor Module is categorised into phases highest phase has the HOD
Initially every student is in phase 0,which means his request isn't sent to anyone.Once he/she submits the request,the request reaches caretaker, once accepted, it reaches professors,once all the professors accept, it reaches HOD finally once he accepts student receives No-Due clearance.
